                         The Saturn Programming Language

What is Saturn?

    Saturn is a general purpose, high-level interpreted programming language
    intending to provide robust features while maintaining extreme simplicity. 

What's Saturn like?

  Syntactically, it is heavily inspired by x86 Assembly. Semantically, it is
  somewhat high level. For example, working with variables is similar for all
  types:

      int myint, 6
      add myint, 4
      str mystr, 'Hello'
      add mystr, 'World!'
      out stdout, mystr
      out stdout, myint

How do I install Saturn?

  Simply clone the repository from GitHub and install using make:

      git clone https://github.com/shintoo/Saturn
      cd Saturn
      make
      sudo make install
