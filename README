                         The Saturn Programming Language

What is Saturn?

    Saturn is a general purpose, high-level interpreted programming language
    intending to maintain extreme simplicity. 

What's Saturn like?

  Syntactically, it is heavily inspired by x86 Assembly. Semantically, it is
  somewhat high level. Here's a peek:

      int exampleint
      rin exampleint, stdin
      out stdout, exampleint
      out stdout, '+10='
      add exampleint, 10
      out stdout, exampleint

How do I install Saturn?

  Simply clone the repository from GitHub and install using make:

      git clone https://github.com/shintoo/Saturn
      cd Saturn
      make
      sudo make install

More information can be found in the Documentation/ directory, and an example
can be found in the ex/ directory.
