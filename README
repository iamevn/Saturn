                      The Saturn Programming Language

What is Saturn?

    Saturn is a general purpose, high-level interpreted programming language
    intending to provide robust features while maintaining extreme simplicity.  

What's Saturn like?

  Syntactically, it is heavily inspired by x86 Assembly. Semantically, it is
  high-level in that it is dynamically typed, and keywords are type-agnostic.
  For example, printing an integer and printing a string to a filestream is
  exactly the same:  

      new myint, 6
      new mystr, 'Hello!\n'
      out stdout, myint
      out stdout, mystr
