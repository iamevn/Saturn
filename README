                         The Saturn Programming Language

What is Saturn?

    Saturn is a general purpose, high-level interpreted programming language
    intending to provide robust features while maintaining extreme simplicity. 

What's Saturn like?

  Syntactically, it is heavily inspired by x86 Assembly. Semantically, it is
  somewhat high level. For example, printing an integer and printing a string
  to a filestream is exactly the same:  

      int myint, 6
      add myint, 4
      str mystr, 'Hello!\n'
      out stdout, myint
      out stdout, mystr
