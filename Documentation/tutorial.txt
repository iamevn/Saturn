Setting Up

  After installing Saturn, you can use the interpreter on your source files
  in two different ways, as per usual. You can enter

      saturn sourcefile.sat

  to run sorucefile.sat, or you can include a shebang and path to the
  interpreter. By default, this is set to /usr/bin, so you may add the line

      #!/usr/bin/saturn

  to the beginning of your source file, and then execute the program with

      ./sourcefile.sat

Basics

 Comments

  Only single-line comments are supported; they begin with the semicolon
  character ';' and end at a newline.

      ; Read in a number, double it, then print the original
      ; and the number doubled
      int orig
      int dbl
      rin orig, stdin     ; Read in from stdin an integer into orig
      mov dbl, orig       ; Copy orig into dbl
      mul dbl, 2          ; Do the doubling
      out stdout, orig    ; Output
      out stdout, '\n'
      out stdout, dbl

 Declarations

  To declare a variable, you specify the type and label, and optionally,
  an initial value:

      int baz                   ; Declares an integer
      flt foo, 10.21            ; Initialize float foo to 10.21
      str bar, 'Hello'          ; Initialize string bar to 'Hello'

 Assignment, and More

  Declared variables can be manipulataed with some instructions:

      mov foo, 0.6              ; Assigns the value 0.6 to foo
      mov bar, 'Saturn'         ; Assigns the value 'Saturn' to bar
      mov baz, 10               ; Assigns the value 10 to baz

      add foo, 10               ; Add 10 to foo
      cat bar, 'v0.1'           ; Concatenate 'v0.1' to 'Saturn
      add baz, 2                ; Add 2 to baz

  The commands 'sub', 'mul', and 'div' can be used just as 'add', to subtract,
  multiply, and divide. Also, there are two commands 'inc' and 'dec', for
  increment and decrement:
